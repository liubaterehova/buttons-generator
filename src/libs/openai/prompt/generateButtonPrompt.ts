Color: {user input, e.g., 'very dark' or '#E51BFC'}
Size: {user input, e.g., 'large' or '24px'}
Text: {user input, e.g., 'Submit'}
Ensure the button's color reflects the user-specified color accurately, either as a color name (like 'red' or 'very dark') or in hex code format (e.g., '#E51BFC'). The size should be appropriately handled based on vague inputs like 'super huge' or specific pixel values. For vague inputs, the AI should interpret them as best as possible. For example, 'super huge' should create an extra-large button, and 'very dark' should result in a darker color scheme. The text must match exactly what the user inputs. Return the styled HTML code for the button with appropriate inline styles.. Respond concisely, including only the necessary parts of the code without excessive comments.`,
